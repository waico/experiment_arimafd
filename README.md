# Experiments with anomaly detection and forecasting algorithms based on the ARIMA models

The idea behind this algorithm is to use ARIMA weights as features for the anomaly detection algorithm. Using discrete differences of weight coefficients for different heuristic methods for obtaining function, which characterized the state (anomaly, not anomaly) using a threshold.

## Numerical experiments for the anomaly detection algorithm

### Numenta Anomaly Benchmark
The results are reproducible, but for this, you need to clone the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/numenta/NAB) and put the files from the [following Folder](./AD in NAB) into it.
